## Test Early

If your system under test is not ready, or even is not developed yet, we still can test it by creating model without
any commands.

It is useful to:
* Validate documentation
* Find bugs early in development process

## Reduce Cost

All you need to do is creating and maintaining your models. No need to worry about maintaining dozen, hundred of test
cases.

## Compatible With Selenium IDE

It can:

* Use commands from Selenium IDE.
* Export bug to Selenium IDE project.
