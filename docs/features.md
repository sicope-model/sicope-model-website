## Test Early

If your system under test is not ready, or even is not developed yet, we still can test it by creating model without
any commands.

It is useful to:
* Validate documentation
* Find bugs early in development process

## Reduce Cost

All you need to do is creating and maintaining your models. No need to worry about maintaining dozen, hundred of test
cases.

## Compatible With Selenium IDE

It can:

* Use commands from Selenium IDE.
* Export bug to Selenium IDE project.

A tester who is familiar with Selenium IDE can start working on this tool quickly.

## Increase Test Coverage

This tool by default generate test case to cover 100% number of places and transitions your model have.

## Exploration Test

Each time running task, a new completely different test case are generated. You can also use Selenium IDE to execute
